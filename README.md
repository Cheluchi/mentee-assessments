# Mentee Accessment

Goal of this activity is to access mentee's skills and find the right placement in the Emergent Works' program.

This activity involves learning basic GitHub features and modifying HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). You will need an email and a strong password. If you already have a GitHub account, feel free to login with your existing account. 
2. Fork this repository. This means you will create a copy of this repository for your account. If you're wondering what a repository is, [a repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories). Figure out how to fork a repository by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).
3. Once you have forked the repository, GitHub will create a GitHub page and generate a domain to host the site. For example, [this](https://emergentworks.github.io/mentee-assessments/) is where the original repository is hosted. Find the domain of your version of the repo by going to `https://emergentworks.github.io/mentee-assessments` except replacing `emergentworks` with your GitHub username.
4. Good job! You are pass the digital literacy section of this assessment.
