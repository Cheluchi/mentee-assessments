# Javascript deep dive

Goal of this assesment is to see js skill level of folks entering tier3 and
pair program to solve some cool js challenges.

The goal here is to use as much hints as possible and use test suite to run mentee's code against to check whether it works as expected or not. (I have mixed feelings about
using tests, on one hand side it can help folks feel more connected with their mentors
because we have some predefined criteria for solving the problem but passing tests this early on can be a pain). If we decide that writing tests is not the best approach we can run ourt js code with node/nodemon and use console.log to see what our result is and if we passed the lab.

# Instructions
Code your solution into the index.js file.
Run `jest` until you get all of the tests to pass.
